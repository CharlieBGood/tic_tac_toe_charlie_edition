#Tic_tac_toe_charlie_edition

Personal version of the famous game tic tac toe (also known as "triqui" in Colombia). This version takes as basis the code of the page TechVidvan and adds to it a couple of cool features. Now the two players can have a name of max 7 letters and the game will keep track of the score. Also, if the players want, they can pick up funny selfies and upload them to the game where a pretty simple Neural Network (obtain from Karan Bhanot's github page) will crop their faces and will set them insted of the X's and O's.
