# **Tic-tac-toe Charlie Edition**

Personal version of the famous game tic tac toe. This version takes as basis the code of the page TechVidvan and adds to it a couple of cool features. Now the two players can have a name of max 7 letters and the game will keep track of the score. Also, if the players want, they can pick up funny selfies and upload them to the game where a pretty simple Neural Network (obtain from Karan Bhanot's github page) will crop their faces and will set them insted of the X's and O's.


## **Requirements:**

numpy, opencv-python, pygame, tkinter

## **Installation of the libraries:**

1. Open the terminal
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Navigate inside the folder
1. Install all dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt

## **How to play:**

1. Run python triqui.py
1. Type players names (max 7 letters)
1. Select players images (if not selected standar X's and O's will be used)
1. Enjoy!
